# Data Structures and Algorithms

Just me trying to solve DSA Questions daily.  

Currently following Striver's SDE Sheet.

My primary language of solving DSA questions is Python, so every question's python file will include different approaches to solve the question and the CPP file will mostly only include the opitmal solution. 

Go to -> Leetcode Questions -> Strivers-SDE-Sheet 

Folders are named as question_number_on_leetcode-question_name
